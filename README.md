HTML and CSS Cheat Sheet

Challenge Project: Build Your Own Cheat Sheet</br>
Your project should document at least one HTML or CSS topic. In our example project, we documented the tags and attributes used in HTML tables layouts, but you can choose any HTML or CSS topic that you’ve learned so far—the sky is the limit!

Possible topics could be:</br>
<ul>
  <li>HTML Tables</li>
  <li>Other HTML tags</li>
  <li>CSS selectors and specificity</li>
  <li>Common CSS properties</li>
</ul>
If you choose to document HTML tags, open the hint to see how to include HTML tags as text in your code.
